    <h1></strong>Educational Background</strong></h1>

    <p>I went to <strong>Thika Road Academy</strong> for my primary school education and later on joined <strong>Precious Blood Secondary School</strong> for my secondary school education where I excelled in logical subjects such as Math, Sciences and Computer. Later on, I joined <em>Goethe Institut<em>  in Nairobi to advance my German language skills to the level of <em>B2</em> so  as to expand my horizons in terms of language.</p>
    <p>As I have always had an interest of pursuing <em>robotics</em> in the future, I decided to pick up programming at the reknowned <strong>Moringa School</strong>. I believe that with the technical skills I gain from Moringa School, I will be a great robotics engineer someday as I will have made a big leap into reaching my <em>ultimate goal<em>.</p>
    <p>As they say, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. I have also invested my time into other interests such as:<p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Playing Guitar<em></li>
      <li><em>Singing<em></li>
      <li><em>Acting in plays<em></li>
    </ul>

    <p>I also enjoy:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gaming</li>
      <li>Bike riding</li>
      <li>Watching science shows</li>
  </ul>
