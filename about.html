  <h1></strong>Educational Background</strong></h1>

  <p>I went to <b>Thika Road Academy</b></a> for my primary school education and later on joined <b>Precious Blood Secondary School</b> for my secondary school education where I excelled in logical subjects such as Math, Sciences and Computer.
    Later on, I joined <a href="https://www.goethe.de/ins/ke/en/index.html">Goethe Institut</a> in Nairobi to advance my German language skills to the level of B2 so as to expand my horizons in terms of language.</p>
  <p>As I have always had an interest of pursuing robotics in the future, I decided to pick up programming at the reknowned <b><a href="https://moringaschool.com/">Moringa School</b></a>. I believe that with the technical skills I gain from Moringa School, I will be a great robotics
    engineer someday as I will have made a big leap into reaching my ultimate goal</p>
