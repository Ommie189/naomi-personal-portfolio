  <h1></strong>Educational Background</strong></h1>

  <p>I went to <strong>Thika Road Academy</strong></a> for my primary school education and later on joined <strong>Precious Blood Secondary School</strong> for my secondary school education where I excelled in logical subjects such as Math, Sciences and Computer.
    Later on, I joined <a href="https://www.goethe.de/ins/ke/en/index.html"><em>Goethe Institut<em></a> in Nairobi to advance my German language skills to the level of <em>B2</em> so as to expand my horizons in terms of language.</p>
  <p>As I have always had an interest of pursuing <em>robotics</em> in the future, I decided to pick up programming at the reknowned <strong>Moringa School</strong>. I believe that with the technical skills I gain from Moringa School, I will be a great robotics
    engineer someday as I will have made a big leap into reaching my <em>ultimate goal<em>.</p>
